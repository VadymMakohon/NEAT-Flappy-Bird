# NEAT-Flappy-Bird
üöÄüïπÔ∏èNEAT Flappy Bird is a project where an artificial intelligence (AI) learns to play the classic Flappy Bird game using the NEAT (NeuroEvolution of Augmenting Topologies) algorithm. The AI agent is trained to navigate through pipes and achieve high scores by optimizing its neural network through evolution.

## Instructions
Simply run flappy_bird.py and watch an AI start training itself to play the game of flappy bird!

## Features
- AI Gameplay: The AI learns to play Flappy Bird using the NEAT algorithm.
- Visualization: Displays the game while the AI is playing, showing the neural networks in action.
- Configurable: NEAT configuration can be adjusted through the neat_config.txt file.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Pygame (for game visualization)
- NEAT-Python (for the NEAT algorithm)
